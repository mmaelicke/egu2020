# SciKit-GStat
## A scipy flavored geostatistical analysis toolbox written in Python

This repository is a demo showcase for my [presentation](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/EGU2020-6678.html) on the [EGU 2020: Sharing Geoscience Online](https://www.egu2020.eu/).

It is deployed using [notebook-classroom](https://github.com/hydrocode-de/notebook-classroom). The Showcase can be selected from the menu above either as a slideshow or as script.

It is also possible to load the script directly in binder (*link missing*) as an executable version.
