# SciKit-GStat
## A scipy flavored geostatistical analysis toolbox written in Python

This repository is a demo showcase for my [presentation](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2020/EGU2020-6678.html) on the [EGU 2020: Sharing Geoscience Online](https://www.egu2020.eu/).

It is deployed using [notebook-classroom](https://github.com/hydrocode-de/notebook-classroom). The Showcase can be selected from the menu above either as a slideshow or as script.

It is also possible to load the script directly in [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mmaelicke/egu2020/master) as an executable version.

The SciKit-GStat Github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/mmaelicke/scikit-gstat) and the documentation can be found [here](https://mmaelicke.github.io/scikit-gstat).
